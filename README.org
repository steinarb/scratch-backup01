* Shiro SessionManager shared across OSGi components

This is an OSGi DS component that is intended as a "poor man's SSO" when using Apache Shiro for web application authentication and authorization, in Apache Karaf.

This DS component exposes a service of type SessionManager and uses a MemorySessionManager to implement the service.

The effect is that when using this session manager, then calling
#+BEGIN_SRC java
  Subject subject = SecurityUtils.getSubject();
#+END_SRC
in a web application, then based on the cookies of the request, a Subject for an already logged in user will be returned, if a user have been logged in to a different web application on the same server, from the same browser.
